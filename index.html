        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>
          Treaty One was the first signed treaty created in Canada. It is also
          <span>the first numbered treaty</span>. What makes Treaty One
          different from other Treaties is the fact that both Treaty One and
          Treaty Two had fewer clauses than the treaties that would follow.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Historic Terms of the Treaty</h3>
        <p>
          The treaty
          <span>
            laid out the boundaries of where the reserves would be for both
            settlers and Indigenous Peoples.
          </span>
          Promises were made for schools too be built in each community, and an
          annuity of $3-$5 for each person registered under the Indian Act. In
          addition, items such as twine, ploughs, boards and oxen for some
          elected Chiefs, headmen and councilors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Implementation of the Treaty in Current Time</h3>
        <p>
          Treaty One establishes clearly defined land ownership and
          jurisdiction, and
          <span>
            foster a new relationship based on mutual respect, trust and
            understanding.
          </span>
          In addition, they provide guidelines on how Europeans can use the
          traditional land that Indigenous Peoples have occupied. They also
          provide documents with Indigenous rights as written in the treaties.
