        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="description-list-style">
            Each band was to receive a reserve large enough to provide 160 acres
            for each family of five.
          </li>
          <li class="description-list-style">
            Each man, woman and child were to be given a gratuity (one time

        <h3>Promises Made From the Side of the First Nations</h3>
        <p>
          First Nations, as written in the text, were to “cede, release,
          surrender and yield to her Majesty Queen” an area of land described in
          the treaty. The land described is present-day southeast and
          south-central Manitoba, including the Red River Valley, and stretching
          north to the lower parts of Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg and west
          along the Assiniboine River to the towns of Portage la Prairie and
